# Schafkopf Offenbach  
![](https://funcardgames.net/assets/images/slateSchafkopf.jpg)

Every Monday night at 7:30pm, we play Schafkopf!  
We meet at a Belgian bar aptly named "Le Belge". It's right by S-Bahn OF Marktplatz:

Bleichstr. 49 
63065 Offenbach

- Join the [Whatsapp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LnXB5OXRJIkLFzX3GVtqlL) to see how many people are coming and let us know if you'll join.
- If we don't assemble a full four players, we also play a one-on-one called 66 ([rules](https://funcardgames.net/sixtysix)).  
- Beginners are welcome, we're happy to teach. Do check out the [rule in English](https://funcardgames.net/schafkopf) before you come.

Some weeks, we play several different nights, but Monday is the standard.
