## Who are we?
Main & Wine is an informal social group of English speakers in the Offenbach area that meets regularly for lunch :pizza: or evening drinks :wine_glass:. We come from all over the world :earth_africa:, but we all speak (some) English. Newcomers are welcome to join at any time! [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/offenbachenglishspeakers) and [Telegram](https://t.me/mainandwine) are our means of communication and organization.
