## Who are we?
Offenbach Social Club is an informal group of English speakers in the Offenbach area that meets regularly for lunch :pizza: or evening drinks :wine_glass:. We've been around since 2021, and come from all over the world :earth_africa:, but we all speak (some) English. Newcomers are welcome to join at any time! 

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/offenbachenglishspeakers), [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/offenbach-social-club/) and [Telegram](https://t.me/offenbachsocialclub) are our means of communication and organization.

- We use Telegram for group-functionality and data-protection reasons.
  - We are not crazies. :D   
  
## Card Table
- In addition to the regular social group, we organize a card players' circle. Most commonly, we play a two-player game called 66. Beginners welcome!
