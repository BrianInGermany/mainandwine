## Who are we?
Main & Wine is an informal social group of English speakers in the Offenbach area. We meet regularly for lunch or evening drinks, and come from all over the world, but we all speak (some) English. Newcomers are very welcome to join us at any time! Facebook and Telegram are our means of communication and organization.
