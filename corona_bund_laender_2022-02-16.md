# Bund-Länder Conference Has Passed Three-Step Rule Roll-Back
As Hessen's Minister President Volker Bouffier reported in front of the press on Wednesday afternoon, 16 February, the conference of the federal government and the Bundesländer has passed a three-step plan to ease the contact and vaccination requirements implemented to stop the spread of the Corona virus.

## Step One: As soon as Hessian parliament enacts the new agreement ("in the course of the coming week")
In step one, private gatherings of over 10 fully vaccinated or recovered individuals will be allowed without a cap. Unvaccinated individuals will not benefit from this step.

## Step Two: 4 March
In step two, gastronomy and hotels will switch to the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).gelten. Discos and nightclubs will open for vaccinated/recovered with a same-day test, or triple-vaccinated individuals (2G+).
Large-scale events (football, etc.) may use 60% (indoor) or 75% of (outdoor) capacity.

## Step Three: 20 March
In step three, "all measures" of the Federal Infection Protection act will be dropped. This means all current rules will be disallowed from that point. For mask requirements, distancing requirements, testing requirements, etc. to be implemented, a new federal law would need to be enacted, in order for Länder like Hessen to be allowed to implement such restrictions. Bouffier expects such a law to be enacted. Chancellor Scholz, in his own press conference, stated that "distancing and masks will be the most important rules", and that a possibility for local hotspot rules via the Bundesländer will be granted.

## Roll-Back Not Guaranteed
Each step leading up to 20 March is not guaranteed, but rather the situation will be evaluated and the relevance of each step confirmed in the days before it takes effect.
