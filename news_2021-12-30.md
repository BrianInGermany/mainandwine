- The dam protecting Offenbach from flooding of the Main river is to be overhauled starting in summer 2022 and beginning in the district of Offenbach-Rumpenheim in the east of the city.

  - This part of the renovation will be performed in 2023-2024.
- All existing passages through the dam will be maintained 
- The dam wall will be augmented by a steel wall for water protection that will be covered in decorative sandstone.
- An original plan to lower the level of the dam to improve the visibility of the Isenburger Schloss, but the Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt, which is responsible for Offenbach, rejected this plan due to worries about flooding.

- The ice skating rink will be postponed to 2023.
