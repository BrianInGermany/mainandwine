- __Sunday, 23 January at 7:00pm__
- __Ernst-Griesheimer-Platz 7__

- The Irish-American session is an event where various musicians of the folk genre gather to sing and play guitar, fiddle, bass, banjo, etc. for your and their own delight.
- An Sibin Offenbach is a gem of a pub with great fish and chips, as well as a full bar and other food.
- The group will meet at the big table at the end of the bar. Look for the bright blue LED name tag with "Main & Wine" on it.
